  <p class="text">The Waterfall There is a certain serenity that water provides to one’s soul. A certain peace, a safety net, knowing that the ocean is the resting place of all those before you. As the water rises, and the bodies of your ancestors sink deeper into the ground, you can be sure to see them in the salt-licked blue when your time comes. Still bodies of water trace their gentle palms over each rock and grain of sand settled at the bottom. Rivers, creeks, and streams hold still their iron gates, dribbling lazily down the bank until they reach a final destination. Protective are the lakes and pools, the ones whose depths reach as cold as the north of Europe. Their icy souls are calm, refreshing against sun-kissed skin. They will hold your frame tight until you can only wade out onto the sand, willing your own shivering to be replaced by sweat so that you may once again enter its grasp. The waterfall is different. The waterfall is ferocious, a roaring beast which plummets into the ground below. The waterfall screams with energy, disturbing the peace of the birds and the bugs around it. The waterfall barrels into the surface below, a bellowing cry: I’m here! I’m here! See me! Feel me! The other waters are afraid of the waterfall. The other waters want to keep their peace, undisturbed unless by bodies of humanity. They want to shut out the waterfall and all its noise, hoping the humans will once and for all forget about the fall’s mighty wrath. They think of the waterfall as if it is the runt: unloved, uncared for. They choose not to accept the waterfall’s mighty strength, but to turn their backs on it. The waterfall wants to believe in itself. It wants to belong with the other waters, to thrive in a coexistence with its peers. But it can only convince itself for so long before it drowns in its self image. It wishes it were quiet, peaceful, calm. It wishes it could feel the people’s skin on its surface and in its depths. Even the humans are afraid of its fall. They build gates, barriers, bridges that run over the outline of the waterfall. They put up signs that warn of a great danger. Keep out!, they yell, in bright red writing, Do not swim in the waterfall! The waterfall knows that the humans will listen. They have systems, orders, and can keep themselves quiet. They are everything the waterfall wishes it was and more. But every once in a while, the children will not listen to the signs. The young ones, the ones with tousled hair and round faces. The ones with a wild smile and even cheekier personalities. They are brave enough to stick grubby fingers through the gates and barriers. They are free enough to ignore the signs. They place a hand in the harsh, cold, screaming surface of the waterfall, and they smile. And the waterfall smiles, for it feels the love of the youth. It feels the parents’ worry, but it absorbs the childrens’ eagerness. It roars louder, harder, and basks in the happiness it can give someone. The waterfall does not need to be like the others, it holds its place with the young ones. While the ocean gives the dead a home, the waterfall protects the new life. That is enough to make the waterfall smile.
